# Target .NET Framework

*(not .NET Core)*

Projects built with PeachPie depend on the PeachPie runtime, which targets **.NET Standard 2.0**. This makes it compatible with the vast array of other .NET frameworks and runtimes, as long as they are compatible with .NET Standard 2.0. This includes .NET Core 2.0, Mono 5.4, Xamarin.Android 8.0, or .NET Framework 4.6.1 or higher.

## Building the project

### Build a library

When compiling a library project to be referenced by other projects, it is always the best option to target the lowest .NET Standard makes it possible for the project to be referenced by a majority of .NET projects. In this case, it is `netstandard2.0`. Make sure you have the following property set in [the project file](/php/msbuild):

```xml
<TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>
```

### Build an executable

In order to build an executable application for the .NET Framework (not .NET Core), target `net461` or higher and specify the output type `exe` in [the project file](/php/msbuild):

```xml
<OutputType>exe</OutputType>
<TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>
```

Optionally, specify [the startup object](/php/msbuild#startupobject), which should be called upon starting the application.

## ASP.NET application

Assuming the project with PHP files is compiled as a library, you can be targeting either `netstandard2.0` or `net461`.

```xml
<TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>
<AssemblyName>MyWebsite</AssemblyName><!-- an optional name -->
```

Add a package reference to request handler:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Peachpie.RequestHandler" Version="1.0.23" />
</ItemGroup>
```

You can handle the requests to `*.php` pages on your ASP.NET (Integrated Pipeline) server (specifically IIS 7, IIS Express or Apache with mod_mono) in two ways; either by modifying `web.config` and passing requests directly to `MyWebsite.dll`, or by handling the requests programatically in your C# code.

### Option 1: Web.Config

Alter the web application's `web.config` file with the following configuration within `<configuration>` root element:

```xml
<system.webServer>
    <handlers>
      <add name="PeachpieHandler" path="*.php" verb="*" type="Peachpie.RequestHandler.RequestHandler, Peachpie.RequestHandler" resourceType="Unspecified" preCondition="integratedMode" />
    </handlers>
</system.webServer>
```

> Ensure the `/bin` folder of your ASP.NET application contains all the necessary assemblies including `MyWebsite.dll`, `Peachpie.RequestHandler.dll` and other Peachpie runtime assemblies. 

### Option 2: Programatically

In order to handle requests to compiled `*.php` pages, make use of the `RequestHandler` API. Obtain the instance of `System.Web.HttpContext` and pass it to the `RequestHandler.ProcessRequest(HttpContext)` method.

```c#
using Peachpie.RequestHandler;
new RequestHandler().ProcessRequest( httpContext );
```

The code above lazily loads PHP library assemblies (e.g. `MyWebsite.dll`) and looks up the compiled script corresponding to a given `httpContext`. If it is found, it gets included and processed.
